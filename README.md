 It's worth taking the time to make your README look nice because it will be the first thing anyone will see in your repositories. If people see that you have a messy or incomplete README, they will assume that your code is also messy or incomplete. But if you have a README with clean formatting and clear setup instructions, your users will have more confidence in trying out your software (and in trying out you, if they're an employer looking to hire!).

Below is a README sample template written in Markdown. You can copy and paste the text into a new file and replace the relevant parts in curly brackets with information about your project. All of the sections from above are included but you can add and delete to make your README look the way you want it to.
